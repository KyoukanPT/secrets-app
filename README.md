<h2>Secrets App</h2>

<p>This a very simple Web App that I created in my spare time to test my MongoDB and Passport JS skills.</p>

<h3>What's the goal of this App?</h3>
<li>We all have secrets and sometimes it is a burden to keep them to ourselves.</li>
<li>What if we could share our secrets without exposing who's behind that secret?</li>
<li>Well now you can with <strong><em>Secrets</strong>. The App where you can share your secrets anonymously!</em></li> 
<h3>How to use the App?</h3>
<li>If you already registered, go to https://kyoukanpt-secrets-app.herokuapp.com/login and use your credentials to login.</li>
<li>In case you didn't register yet, do so here: https://kyoukanpt-secrets-app.herokuapp.com/register.</li>
<li>After a successful register/login, you will be able to submit your own secret. Which will be rendered on the "secrets" page.</li>
<li>Alternatively, you can also check which secrets have been submitted, without needing to register/login, by going here: https://kyoukanpt-secrets-app.herokuapp.com/secrets.</li>
<h4>Note: Only 1 secret can be submitted per user. If you submit another secret, the previous one will be deleted.</h4>

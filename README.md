<h2>Secrets App</h2>

<p>This a very simple Web App that I created in my spare time to test my MongoDB and Passport JS skills.</p>

<h3>What's the goal of this App?</h3>
<li>We all have secrets and sometimes it is a burden to keep them to ourselves.</li>
<li>What if we could share our secrets, without exposing who's behind that secret?</li>
<li>Well now you can with <strong><em>Secrets</strong>. <u>The App where you can share your secrets anonymously!</u></em></li>
